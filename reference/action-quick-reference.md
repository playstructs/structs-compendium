# Action Quick Reference

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Last Updated**: December 7, 2025  
**Purpose**: Quick reference guide for AI agents performing game actions

## Overview

This guide provides a quick reference for all game actions available to AI agents. For complete action definitions, see `schemas/actions.json` and `reference/action-index.json`.

**All actions are submitted as transactions** to: `POST /cosmos/tx/v1beta1/txs`

## ⚠️ Deprecated Actions

The following actions are **deprecated** and should not be used. Use the replacement actions instead:

| Deprecated Action | Replacement | Reason |
|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| `reactor-allocate` | Use allocation system (`MsgAllocationCreate`) | Message type does not exist. Energy allocation handled via allocation system. |
| `substation-connect` | `MsgSubstationAllocationConnect` | Message type does not exist. Use allocation-based connection. |
| `agreement-create` | `agreement-open` (`MsgAgreementOpen`) | Message type does not exist. Use `MsgAgreementOpen` instead. |
| `ore-mining` | `struct-ore-miner-complete` (`MsgStructOreMinerComplete`) | Message type does not exist. Use struct-based mining completion. |
| `ore-refining` | `struct-ore-refinery-complete` (`MsgStructOreRefineryComplete`) | Message type does not exist. Use struct-based refining completion. |
| `generator-allocate` | `struct-generator-infuse` (`MsgStructGeneratorInfuse`) | Message type does not exist. Use struct-based generator infusion. |
| `guild-membership-leave` | `guild-membership-kick` (`MsgGuildMembershipKick`) | Message type does not exist. Use kick action for removing members. |

## Common Requirements

### Player Requirements

**Player Online**:
- Player must not be halted
- Check: `GET /structs/player/{id}` → `player.halted === false`

**Sufficient Resources**:
- Player must have required resources
- Check: Query player resources before action

### Struct Requirements

**Sufficient Charge**:
- Struct must have required charge
- Check: `GET /structs/struct/{id}` → `struct.charge >= required`

**Sufficient Power**:
- Player must have power capacity > struct passive draw
- Check: Query player power capacity

**Command Ship Online**:
- Command Ship must be built AND online
- Check: Query fleet for Command Ship struct

**Fleet Status**:
- Fleet must be on station (for building)
- Fleet must be away (for raids)
- Check: Query fleet status

### Location Requirements

**Valid Location**:
- Location must be valid and accessible
- Check: Query location before action

**Valid Target**:
- Target must be valid and attackable
- Check: Query target before attack

---

## Action Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Action

**Use Case**: Simple action, no dependencies

**Flow**:
1. Check requirements
2. Build transaction
3. Sign transaction
4. Submit transaction
5. Wait for confirmation
6. Verify action occurred

**Example**: `struct-activate`, `struct-deactivate`

---

### Pattern 2: Two-Step Action

**Use Case**: Action requires two steps

**Flow**:
1. Step 1: Initiate action
2. Wait for confirmation
3. Query state (wait for intermediate state)
4. Step 2: Complete action
5. Wait for confirmation
6. Verify action occurred

**Examples**:
- `struct-build-initiate` → `struct-build-complete`
- Mining: Initiate → Complete (with proof-of-work)

---

### Pattern 3: Action with Proof-of-Work

**Use Case**: Action requires proof-of-work computation

**Flow**:
1. Initiate action
2. Wait for confirmation
3. Query struct state
4. Compute proof-of-work
5. Complete action with proof
6. Wait for confirmation
7. Verify action occurred

**Examples**:
- `struct-build-complete`
- `planet-raid-complete`
- `struct-ore-miner-complete`
- `struct-ore-refinery-complete`

**See**: `protocols/action-protocol.md#proof-of-work` for proof-of-work details

---

### Pattern 4: Conditional Action

**Use Case**: Action depends on game state

**Flow**:
1. Query game state
2. Check preconditions
3. If conditions met: Execute action
4. If conditions not met: Wait or abort
5. Verify action occurred

**Example**: Attack only if target is valid and attackable

---

## Transaction Flow

### Complete Flow

```json
{
  "flow": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "action": "Get account info",
      "endpoint": "GET /cosmos/auth/v1beta1/accounts/{address}"
    },
    {
      "step": 2,
      "action": "Build transaction",
      "message": "Action message (e.g., MsgStructBuild)"
    },
    {
      "step": 3,
      "action": "Sign transaction",
      "method": "Sign with private key"
    },
    {
      "step": 4,
      "action": "Submit transaction",
      "endpoint": "POST /cosmos/tx/v1beta1/txs"
    },
    {
      "step": 5,
      "action": "Wait for confirmation",
      "check": "Transaction status"
    },
    {
      "step": 6,
      "action": "Verify action occurred",
      "method": "Query game state"
    }
  ]
}
```

**See**: `protocols/action-protocol.md` for complete details

---

## Validation Warning

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Transaction status `broadcast` does NOT mean action succeeded!

**Validation happens on-chain** after broadcast:
1. Transaction broadcasts successfully
2. on-chain validation checks requirements
3. Action succeeds OR fails based on validation
4. **Always verify game state** to confirm action occurred

**Example**:
```json
{
  "scenario": "Build struct without sufficient resources",
  "result": {
    "transaction": "broadcast",
    "action": "failed",
    "reason": "Insufficient resources (validated on-chain)"
  },
  "verification": "Query struct - struct not created"
}
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors

**Player Halted** (code: 6):
- Player is offline/halted
- **Action**: Wait for player to come online

**Insufficient Funds** (code: 2):
- Player doesn't have required resources
- **Action**: Check resources, wait, or abort

**Insufficient Charge** (code: 7):
- Struct doesn't have required charge
- **Action**: Wait for charge to accumulate

**Invalid Location** (code: 8):
- Location is invalid or inaccessible
- **Action**: Verify location, correct, and retry

**Invalid Target** (code: 9):
- Target is invalid or not attackable
- **Action**: Verify target, correct, and retry

**See**: `api/error-codes.yaml` for complete error catalog

## Quick Tips

1. **Always check requirements** before submitting action
2. **Verify action occurred** by querying game state
3. **Handle errors gracefully** with retry logic
4. **Use two-step pattern** for build/mining actions
5. **Compute proof-of-work** for actions that require it
6. **Wait for confirmations** before proceeding
7. **Query game state** to verify action success
8. **Handle validation failures** appropriately
