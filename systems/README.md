## System Documentation

### Core Systems

- **`power-system.md`** - Power/energy system (capacity, load, requirements)
- **`resource-system.md`** - Resource system (ore, Alpha Matter, Watts, security)
- **`fleet-system.md`** - Fleet system (status, operations, requirements)

## System Overview

### Power System

**Purpose**: Manage energy (Watts) production and consumption

**Key Concepts**:
- Capacity vs Load
- Available power calculation
- Power requirements for building
- Player online status

**Reference**: `power-system.md`

---

### Resource System

**Purpose**: Manage raw materials, refined materials, and energy

**Key Concepts**:
- Resource types (ore, Alpha Matter, Watts)
- Resource security (stealable vs secure)
- Resource flow (mining → refinement → conversion)
- Conversion rates

**Reference**: `resource-system.md`

### Fleet System

**Purpose**: Manage player fleets and mobile structs

**Key Concepts**:
- Fleet status (onStation vs away)
- Command Ship requirement
- Fleet operations (building, movement)
- Fleet structure

**Reference**: `fleet-system.md`
